*Welcome to **Starlight**, a cross-platform 3D game engine I am making as a learning project.*
*The goal of this project is to end up as a simple, usable, general purpose game engine for desktop platforms.*

## :toolbox: Prerequisites

### Build dependencies

- [CMake 3.25+](https://cmake.org/download) to generate the build system
- A C++20 compatible compiler
- (Recommended) An IDE with code completion and syntax highlighting, such as:
	- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
	- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs)
	- [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)

### CMakePresets dependencies

- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) as the compiler
- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) as the build system
- [Vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for dependencies

### :hammer_and_wrench: Building the project
